# Sales Data Analysis: Advanced MySQL Queries on 50k Transactions
## Executive Summary & Actionable Recommendations
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a 50,000-row transactional dataset, demonstrating proficiency in advanced SQL for deriving key business metrics. The findings lead to immediate, data-driven strategies focused on customer value and performance monitoring.

Key Recommendations:
[Recommendation 1: Targeting] [X]% of total revenue is generated by the High Spender customer segment (Query 4). Recommendation: [Specific Action, e.g., Implement targeted loyalty campaigns exclusively for this segment to boost retention.]

[Recommendation 2: Performance Monitoring] The time-series analysis (Query 1) identified a significant [Trend, e.g., 20% decline] in MoM revenue growth during [Month/Quarter]. Recommendation: [Specific Action, e.g., Cross-reference this period with marketing spend and product inventory levels to diagnose the cause.]

[Recommendation 3: Product Focus] The [Product Category] category is the most popular globally (Query 10), but the Average Order Value (AOV) is [Lower/Higher] than the [Another Category] category (Query 6). Recommendation: [Specific Action, e.g., Develop bundling strategies for the popular category to increase its AOV.]

## Methodology: Advanced MySQL Analysis
The primary focus was using advanced SQL capabilities to move beyond simple aggregation. The following table explains the analytical goal and the specific technique employed in the queries.sql file.

Query Focus

MySQL Technique Demonstrated

Analytical Goal

MoM Growth Rate (Q1)

LAG() Window Function, DATE_FORMAT(), NULLIF()

Calculates time-series momentum and percentage change while safely handling division by zero.

Outlier Identification (Q3)

INNER JOIN on Aggregate Subquery

Flags individual transactions that exceed a category's average purchase amount by 2x.

Relative Segmentation (Q4)

NTILE(3) Window Function

Dynamically classifies the entire user base into equally sized High, Medium, and Low Spending tiers.

Payment Method Pivot (Q5)

SUM(CASE WHEN ...) Conditional Aggregation

Creates a pivot table directly in SQL to summarize revenue contributions by country and payment type.

Top N per Group (Q10)

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY...)

Efficiently ranks categories within each country to find the Top 3 most popular (by transaction count).

Running Total (Q8)

SUM() OVER (ORDER BY ...) Window Function

Calculates the cumulative revenue over the project's entire time period.

## Data Visualization & Summary
The raw SQL output was translated into visual and summarized formats for easy consumption.

1. Visualization Summary
The charts below showcase the most critical findings derived from the queries:

Chart Title

Query Source

Key Insight

MoM Revenue Trend

Query 1

[Insert one sentence insight about the trend, e.g., "Identifies Q3 as a period of consistent revenue decay."]

Category Market Share

Query 7

[Insert one sentence insight about product concentration, e.g., "Confirms high reliance on the 'Electronics' category for 45% of total revenue."]

Reference the charts in the analysis/ folder for visual proof:
[Insert Link or Image Tag for MoM Trend Chart]
[Insert Link or Image Tag for Category Share Chart]

2. Pivot Table Summary
The Pivot Table focused on [Pivot Table Focus: e.g., Total Revenue by Country and Payment Method].

Primary Takeaway: [One sentence finding, e.g., "The US market shows a distinct 80/20 preference for Credit Card payments, while the Canadian market is split evenly across PayPal and Bank Transfer."]

## Setup and Reproducibility
To replicate this analysis, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: git clone [Your Repo URL]

Database Setup (MySQL 8.0+): Create a new schema (e.g., CREATE DATABASE sales_db;).

Data Import: Import sales_data.csv into a table named Transactions.

Execute Queries: Run the entire script: SOURCE sql/queries.sql;
